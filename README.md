# deluxe
The deluxe version of JavaScript web app frameworks.

*Warning - This project is currently a work in progress* 
Do not expect it to work until I say so.

## Goal
The most elegant web development experience ever made.

## Core Philosophy
1. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are the language of web apps
2. HTML is for views
3. JavaScript is for control
4. CSS is for style

## Progressive Enhancement
1. Start with static HTML
2. If needed use CSS for styling
3. If needed use JavaScript to make things dynamic
4. Statically render and cache everything that does not have to be dynamic

## Syntactic Sugar
1. Enhance the developer experience with Pug, Stylus, Markdown, and CoffeeScript as first class syntax.
2. Support vanilla CSS or vanilla JS or any other language that can preprocessed into JS or CSS.
3. Support Single File Compenents that contain scoped scripts, styles, and templates, but offer the alternative to use separate files.

## Convention Over Configuration
1. Use folder structure and filenames for routing, static files, imports, etc.
2. Provide YAML metadata for routes, speed up development with dumby data, provide overrides, tune caching, etc.

## Framwork Agnostic
1. Compatible with Vue, React, jQuery, HTMX, whatever you like for one off components

## SOTA Developer Experience
1. AI optimized documentation
2. Syntax highlighting support for VS Code, NeoVim, Cursor
3. Live updates in local development environment
4. One click deployment to major web app hosts

## Companion Libraries
1. Single Sign On middleware with route level awareness of roles and permissions.
2. Static image and file DAM with flat file storage and utilities
3. CLI tool for local .env management


### Inspiration
Jeff Escalante made a static compiler, Roots at one point and it was super deluxe at the time.  It fell apart when everyone started to use Babel and ES6 / ES2015 came along and all the frameworks started adopting Classes and React became a dominant tool.  But we're back baby!
